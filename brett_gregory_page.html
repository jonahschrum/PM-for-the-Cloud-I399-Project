<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>My name is Brett Gregory and I am a senior in Informatics with a business cognate originally from Pittsburgh,PA but now resides in 
    Bloomfield Hills, MI. Some of my academic interests include courses that focus on the relationship between humans and technology, 
    and a personal interest of mine is watching sports, primarily the NFL. This summer, I intend on looking to accept a Business Analyst 
    job wherever that may end up being.
